## ‚ú® Features

- Secure file encryption using AES-256-CBC and AES-128-CBC
- Multiple file binding support
- Custom stub executable configuration
- Zero external dependencies for runtime

## üöÄ Installation
No installation providing, just build and run.

## üìñ Usage

### Basic Command Structure
```bash
any-file-binder.exe -f <files...> [-s <stub>] [-o <output>]
```

### Command Arguments
| Argument | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `-f, --files` | Files to bind (multiple allowed) | Required |
| `-s, --stub` | Custom stub executable path | `stub.exe` |
| `-o, --output` | Output file path | `output.exe` |

## üîß Technical Details

### Binary Structure
The binder combines multiple files into a single executable in a simple and secure way:

```
[Stub Executable][__PARSE_STUB__][Metadata][Bound Files]
```
